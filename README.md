# Student-Record-Management-System
It's designed to help manage student information through a simple, text-based interface. Users can perform essential operations like:

Adding new student records (with details like ID, name, age, and grade).
Viewing a list of all enrolled students.
Updating the details of existing students.
Deleting student records.
A key feature is its persistence: all student data is automatically saved to and loaded from a text file (named students.txt). This ensures that the records are not lost when the application closes and are available the next time it's launched.
